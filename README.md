# autowebapp
Another tentative to create an efficient way to manage OS X Web Apps

Just run autowebapp binary (some recipe can be run as admin but most will need to be run as root).

autowebapp is a CLI, you can use it in two ways:
```
bash$ autowebapp <verb>
```

or 

```
bash$ autowebapp 
autowebapp: <verb>
```
